# metin2-suite

Single-player Metin2 server suite: a Linux port of the r40250 server, a launcher,
a Flask admin panel, and the playerbot AI that populates the world.

## Layout

The engine source is **not in this repository** and never will be — see
`linux-port/fetch-sources.sh`. Our side of the server is one overlay:

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `linux-port/overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/` | The playerbot AI, split into implementation fragments (see below). `playerbot_manager.cpp` is the tick and whatever has not been lifted out yet. |
| `linux-port/overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/playerbot_world_rules.h` | Pure travel policy, no engine types. Unit-tested. The model for extracting logic. |
| `linux-port/patches/` | Patches applied to the pristine engine source. |
| `linux-port/docker/panel/app/admin_panel.py` | Flask admin panel. |
| `tests/playerbot_world_rules_test.cpp` | The only C++ unit test. |

Reference copies of the engine, needed to check any API before using it:

- `../m2src-cache/tree/port40250/server/` — staged, patched build tree (`game/src`, `common/`, `extern/include`)
- `../../backups/m1-best-*/game-server/game/src/` — engine sources incl. `fishing.cpp`, `char.cpp`
- `../m2src-cache/tree/server40250/share/` — runtime data: `conf/item_proto.txt`, `conf/item_names_pl.txt`, `conf/mob_names_pl.txt`, `locale/english/map/*/`

## Verifying a change

There is no local compiler; the build is 32-bit C++23 in Docker. Syntax-check the
overlay against the real headers — this catches almost everything and takes about
a minute:

```bash
cd ../m2src-cache/tree/port40250
cp <repo>/linux-port/overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/playerbot_manager.cpp server/game/src/
cp <repo>/linux-port/overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/playerbot_world_rules.h server/game/src/
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm -v "$(pwd -W)":/src -w /src/server/game/src gcc:13 bash -c \
  "apt-get update -qq >/dev/null 2>&1 && apt-get install -y -qq g++-multilib >/dev/null 2>&1; \
   g++ -fsyntax-only -m32 -std=c++23 -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-parameter -fexceptions \
   -D_THREAD_SAFE -DNDEBUG -DBOOST_BIND_GLOBAL_PLACEHOLDERS \
   -I../../../extern/include -I../../liblua/include -I../../libserverkey playerbot_manager.cpp; \
   echo EXIT=\$?"
```

`-m32` is mandatory: `packet.h` static-asserts a 32-bit `time_t` and the wire/DB
layouts depend on it. Restore the staged copies afterwards — they belong to the
build cache, not to us.

Unit test:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd -W)":/w -w /w gcc:13 \
  bash -c "g++ -Wall -Wextra -o /tmp/t tests/playerbot_world_rules_test.cpp && /tmp/t"
```

Nothing here can be runtime-tested locally; the live signal comes from operators
running ~350 bots. Say plainly what was compiled versus what was observed.

### Adding a source file

Nothing to do. Drop a `playerbot_*.h` or `playerbot_*.cpp` into
`overlays/playerbot/src/game/src/` and every step finds it: `prepare-context.sh`
discovers the directory, the engine `Makefile` takes `$(wildcard
playerbot_*.cpp)`, the update packager expands `playerbot_*` in
`server-update-files.txt`, and the launcher copies the whole directory into the
build context before each build.

This used to cost five edits in `prepare-context.sh` alone plus a patch edit,
which is exactly why the manager grew to twelve thousand lines instead of being
split up -- and why 1.22.4 and 1.23.2 both shipped a manager without its own
headers and would not compile on any player's machine. If you add a step that
handles these files, make it discover them too. Never write another list.

## The playerbot sources

Everything shares **one translation unit and one anonymous namespace**, so
definition order *is* dependency order: a helper must appear above its callers.
The split is therefore a sequence of implementation fragments, included in
dependency order at the top of `playerbot_manager.cpp`:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `playerbot_types.h` | Tuning constants, enums, `TPlayerBotAIState` and the state map. |
| `playerbot_world_rules.h` | Pure travel policy. No engine types, unit-tested. |
| `playerbot_navigation.h` | Where a bot may stand and how it gets there. Answers questions about the world only; calls nothing above it. |
| `playerbot_world_memory.h` | What the population has learned about the world, as opposed to about itself. Written by one subsystem, read by another. |
| `playerbot_gear.h` | What a bot wears and carries: equipment scoring, the progression ladder, arrows, potions. |
| `playerbot_manager.cpp` | The tick, plus every subsystem not yet lifted out. |

These are fragments, not normal headers: each defines objects, relies on the
engine headers the manager includes above it, and reopens the same anonymous
namespace. Include each exactly once, from `playerbot_manager.cpp`, in an order
that respects what it calls. A fragment that needs something from a later
subsystem forward-declares it rather than pulling it in -- `playerbot_gear.h`
does this for `GetPlayerBotNpcApproach`.

Still in `playerbot_manager.cpp`, and the obvious next cuts: movement
(`ClearPlayerBotRoute` through `MovePlayerBot`), the activities (horse, fishing,
biologist, hunting missions), combat, and the town/merchant economy.

Find a subsystem by its entry point rather than by line number:

- Navigation/travel: `MovePlayerBot`, `TransitionPlayerBotMap` (an instant warp),
  `MovePlayerBotToWorldPortal` (walks), `ManagePlayerBotWorldTravel`
- Combat: `FindDistributedTarget`, `ExecutePlayerBotBasicAttack`,
  `ExecutePlayerBotAttackSkill`, `HandlePlayerBotMultiPull`
- Economy: `ManagePlayerBotEquipment`, `IsPlayerBotJunkItem`,
  `ManagePlayerBot*Merchant`, `ManagePlayerBotRefining`, `ManagePlayerBotPrivateShop`,
  `ManagePlayerBotBonusReroll`
- Activities: `ManagePlayerBotHorse`, `ManagePlayerBotFishing`,
  `ManagePlayerBotBiologist`, `HandlePlayerBotTownVisit`
- Planning/report: `PlanPlayerBotLongTermGoal`, `BuildPlayerBotStatusText`

`CPlayerBotManager::Update` is the tick. Order matters and is load-bearing:
releasing an open private shop runs first -- engine state must not depend on
which subsystem wins the tick -- then the goal planner, then the subsystem hooks
(each `continue`s to claim the tick), and target acquisition and attacking run
**last**. A subsystem that owns the tick therefore also suppresses combat and the
gear pass.

### Traps this file has already sprung

- `TPlayerBotAIState` member init order must match declaration order, or `-Wreorder`
  fires (the build uses `-w`, so check with `-Wall` explicitly).
- `IsPlayerBotJunkItem` **defaults to `return true`**. Anything worth keeping needs
  an explicit exemption, or bots vendor it on the next town trip.
- The inactivity watchdog resets a bot that has not moved, fought or cast for
  ~90 s. Any activity that legitimately stands still must be exempted there.
- `TMonkeyVisitContext` is initialised positionally in the test. Inserting a field
  silently shifts every later value while still compiling.
- `CHARACTER::fishing()` dereferences the sectree map and tile with no null check.

## Engine facts worth not re-deriving

- Item types/subtypes live in `common/item_length.h`; map attributes and
  `SECTREE_SIZE`/`CELL_SIZE` in `game/src/sectree.h`.
- Map world coordinates: `world = BasePosition + cell * 100`, with `BasePosition`
  from the map's `Setting.txt` and `cell` from `npc.txt`. Map 21 is `metin2_map_b1`.
- `server_attr` is per-sector lzo1x: `int32 width, height`, then per sector a
  `uint32` size and a block expanding to 128×128 `uint32` attributes, one per
  50 world units. `ATTR_BLOCK = 1<<0`, `ATTR_WATER = 1<<1`. Decoder and a terrain
  dump: `tools/decode_server_attr.py`.
- Fishing: the rod goes in `WEAR_WEAPON`; bait is **not** consumed from the pouch
  but written into the rod's socket 2 by using a bait item. A cast bites after
  10–40 s and then leaves a 6 s window; `fishing::Compute` peaks ~3 s after the
  bite. Calling `fishing()` while a cast is live is the same as pulling.

## `PLAYERBOTS_FEATURE_SPECS.md`

Design intent, not a reference. It was written independently of the code and its
constants are frequently wrong — verify every VNUM, distance and API call against
the engine before using it. Modules 2 and 3 in it are already implemented, and
implemented differently from what it describes.

## Conventions

- Comments explain *why*, in English, in the voice of the surrounding code.
  Prefer explaining the constraint that forced the shape over restating the code.
- Log with the `PLAYERBOT_<AREA>:` prefix and include `pid=` and `name=`.
- Player-visible bot strings are Polish, ASCII-only (no diacritics).
- Tune with named constants at the top of the namespace, not inline literals.
- Commit messages are lowercase `type(scope): summary` in the imperative.
